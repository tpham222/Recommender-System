    "There are multiple ways to implement a recommender system. One way that will be explored in this project is matrix factorization. This method factorizes a User x Item matrix of ratings into two smaller matrices: a Users matrix and an Items matrix. These smaller matrices will contain latent features.The values of these latent features can be estimated based on the known values in the original User x Item matrix. The dot product can be applied to the User and the Item matrices in order to calculate the estimated values for each user/item pair. By performing gradient descent, the values of the latent features that best estimate the actual matrix can be calculated. Therefore, the dot product can be used on the user/item pairs that did not originally have ratings. Of all the items that a particular user did not have ratings for, the top 5 highest estimated ratings can be recommended.  \n",

    "Matrix factorization is the used to break down a larger matrix of user/item pairs of ratings into separate users and items matrices so that the dot product can be performed to make predictions on unrated items for a user. Using scikit surprise, the SVD model was fit to the entire dataset with the hyperparameters that performed the best in the grid search. The model was cross validated to ensure that it would perform equally well on different subsets of the data. It was found that the average RMSE of the model was 1.0903. The model allows for predictions of user/item ratings. A function was then made so that the top N recommendations can be provided for any reviewer. This function returns a list of the top items that has not be rated by the reviewer yet."
